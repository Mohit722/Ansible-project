# Ansible Project: Setting Up Build Machines with Docker and Maven:

This Ansible project is designed to simplify the setup of build machines by automating the installation of Docker and Maven. The project uses a dynamic inventory file and supports customization of software versions through extra variables.

"This Ansible project is designed for code reuse, making it easier to set up Docker and Maven on targeted machines. The project includes a `roles` folder with Docker and Maven directories, and the `buildsetup.yml` file is used to execute Maven binaries on the target machine. It also leverages a dynamic inventory file, which can be edited to specify the target machines. The Ansible playbook executes two tasks: setting up Docker and Maven on the targeted node, ensuring that the instances are ready with these essential tools installed. To use this project, simply clone the repository on the Ansible controller machine, make minor changes to the dynamic inventory file, and specify the required Maven and JDK versions if necessary."

Prerequisites:

- Ansible should be installed on the controller machine.
- SSH access must be configured with the target machines, and the necessary PEM files should be available.

Steps to Use the Project:

1). Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository containing all the Ansible files, including the dynamic inventory file `demohosts`:

bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd Ansible-project


This step ensures you have the necessary playbooks, roles, and inventory files locally on your Ansible controller.

2). Add the Target Machine to Inventory

Edit the `/etc/ansible/hosts` file to add the target machine's details:

1. Edit the Dynamic Inventory File:  
   Open the `demohosts` file to add your target machineâ€™s details:
   
   bash
   vi demohosts
   
   
   Example of a host entry in `demohosts`:

   
   [demo]
   Buildserver ansible_host=<ip_address> ansible_user=ubuntu ansible_ssh_private_key_file=/etc/ansible/master.pem
   

2. Save the File:  
   This setup allows Ansible to communicate with the target machine using SSH.

 
 3). Execute the Playbook

Run the Ansible playbook with the following command, specifying the dynamic inventory file:

bash
ansible-playbook buildsetup.yml -i /home/ubuntu/project/demohosts


This command applies the playbook to the target machine using the specified inventory, setting up Maven, JDK, and Docker.

4). Passing Extra Variables

If you need to install a different version of Maven, pass the version number as an extra variable during playbook execution:

bash
ansible-playbook buildsetup.yml -i /home/ubuntu/project/demohosts --extra-vars "maven_version=3.8.1"


This approach allows you to update software versions without modifying the playbook or role files.

5. Understanding the Project Structure

This project includes the following essential components:

- Playbooks: The `buildsetup.yml` playbook is responsible for setting up the target machine with Maven, JDK, and Docker.
- Roles: The `roles` directory contains reusable Ansible roles for setting up Docker and Maven.
- Inventory: The dynamic inventory file `demohosts` specifies the target machines and their connection details.



'By following these steps, you can easily configure a build machine to set up Maven, JDK, Git, and Docker. The project is designed to be flexible and easy to use, allowing you to clone the repository, make minor adjustments, and start executing the Ansible playbook with minimal effort. Ansible makes automation simple and efficient'
