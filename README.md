This Ansible project is designed for code reuse, making it easier to set up Docker and Maven on targeted machines. The project includes a `roles` folder with Docker and Maven directories, and the `buildsetup.yml` file is used to execute Maven binaries on the target machine. It also leverages a dynamic inventory file, which can be edited to specify the target machines. The Ansible playbook executes two tasks: setting up Docker and Maven on the targeted node, ensuring that the instances are ready with these essential tools installed. To use this project, simply clone the repository on the Ansible controller machine, make minor changes to the dynamic inventory file, and specify the required Maven and JDK versions if necessary.
